 Car Rental System

This project is a complete Full-Stack Car Rental Management System that I designed and developed entirely by myself.  
It is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with a secure backend, modern frontend, and integrated payment options.
The system is designed to support role-based access control (Admin, Employee, Customer) and provides a smooth workflow for car inventory management, booking, and payments.
 About
I implemented this system from scratch, handling both the frontend UI/UX and the backend REST API development.  
Key highlights:
 Responsive and modern React.js frontend
Express.js & Node.js backend API with authentication  
MongoDB database for storing cars, users, and bookings  
Telebirr and bank transfer integration for payments  

  Features
Admin Panel – manage cars, users, and bookings  
Employee Panel – assist customers and manage rentals  
Customer Portal – browse cars, make bookings, and view history  
Authentication & Authorization – secure login with JWT  
Payments – Telebirr, cash, or bank transfer  
Reports & History – track all past rentals
